## Background

I have a lot of photos from many events. I practically document everything.

Example: My roommates went up to Mackinac Island, and I more or less documented everything we did.

## The project

It would be cool to process all the photos and metadata (timestamps, locations, etc) into a cohesive story.

The story won't be just words, but Visuals.
